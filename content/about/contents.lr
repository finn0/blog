body:

Hi! I'm a junior year student at University of Calcutta, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I’m passionate about programming and mathematics, currently trying out a number of areas, ranging from pure mathematics to security. I love enhancing my configuration of Debian and Qubes-OS Linux setup.

When not coding, I’m usually either watching television shows, reading Manga or novels.
